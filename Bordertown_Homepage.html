            <h1>Opportunity is like an orbit</h1>

            <h2><span class="not-bold">When Greg Silker had the idea for Bordertown Coffee, the idea was by all measures unlikely. The old
                house had sat abandoned for many years , held together by the engineering and huge timbers that were its
                foundation.<br><br>
                It took many years, after the first attempt, to purchase the building. At one point this place was
                slated for demolition to make way for the first of many apartment buildings. But God, it seemed, had
                different plans.</span></h2>

            <h1>Standing the test of time</h1>

            <h2><span class="not-bold">In 2002 riots in Dinkytown resulted from a big University of Minnesota hockey win. Bordertown was almost
                burned to the ground by the rioters but for the efforts of a local benevolent group of students from
                Sigma Nu. Bordertown is now one of the last pieces of historic Dinkytown that is still intact.<br><br>
                We have met so many amazing people, and there are a thousand stories to tell. Every day is a blessing,
                and we don't take a single one for granted!</span></h2>
